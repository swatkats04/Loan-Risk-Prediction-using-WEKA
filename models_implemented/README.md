# Algorithms
Two algorithms-j48, RandomForest classification algorithms-were used in this paper to construct predictive models that can be used to predict and identify loan applications that were introduced by customers to good or bad loans by investigating consumer habits and previous pay back credit.

## J48
J48 is a re-implementation of Ross Quinlan's C4.5 algorithm. It is a decision tree classifier . 
J48 takes the set of tables as an input and generates a decision tree as an output. The generated decision tree is alike to the structure of tree.

## Random Forest
Random forest, like its name implies, consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our modelâ€™s prediction .
